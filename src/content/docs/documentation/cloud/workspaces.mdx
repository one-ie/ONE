### 1. Accessing Workspaces

- Upon logging into the application, locate the workspace navigation area. This could be represented as a dropdown menu, sidebar, or a section labeled “Workspaces.”

### 2. Creating a New Workspace

- Look for a "Create Workspace," "New Workspace," or a "+" icon, usually found near the current workspace's name or within the workspace navigation area.
- Click on this option to initiate the creation process.
- You will be prompted to enter details for your new workspace, such as:
    - **Name:** Choose a descriptive name for your workspace.
    - **Description:** (Optional) Provide a brief description of your workspace's purpose.
    - **Settings:** Depending on the application, you may be able to set preferences for model type, default prompt settings, temperature settings for AI responses, and more during creation.
- Submit the form to create your new workspace. The application may redirect you to your new workspace or require you to manually select it from your workspace list.

### 3. Configuring Workspace Settings

- To modify workspace settings after creation, look for a "Settings" option within your workspace. This could be in the form of a gear icon or found in a dropdown menu.
- In the workspace settings, you can typically change the workspace's name, description, and various default settings related to the behavior of the workspace, such as model choice, prompt behavior, and AI response settings.
- Certain settings, such as the "is_home" attribute indicating a primary personal workspace, may not be editable post-creation to prevent accidental alteration of core workspace characteristics.
- Save your changes to update the workspace settings.

### 4. Switching Between Workspaces

- If you have multiple workspaces, you can switch between them using the workspace navigation feature.
- Select the workspace you wish to access from the list or dropdown menu. The application will update to reflect the context of the selected workspace.

### 5. Deleting a Workspace

- If you need to delete a workspace, navigate to the workspace settings or look for a "Delete Workspace" option. Note that this option might not be available for certain workspaces, such as your primary or "home" workspace.
- Be cautious with this action as deleting a workspace might be irreversible and could result in loss of all data and configurations within that workspace.

### 6. Managing Workspace Members and Sharing

- Workspaces may offer features for sharing or collaboration, allowing you to manage access for other users.
- Look for a "Sharing" or "Members" option within the workspace settings to add, remove, or modify the permissions of other users.
- Keep in mind the sharing settings of your workspaces to control visibility and access: settings like "public," "private," or "shared" determine who can see and interact with the workspace.

### 7. Utilizing Workspace-Specific Features

- Take advantage of workspace-specific features such as embedding models, setting default prompts, and customizing AI response behavior to tailor the workspace to your specific needs or projects.
