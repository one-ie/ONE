# Deploying Your Site on Cloudflare: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

Astro is a modern web framework for building fast, content-focused websites. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) enhances its performance by pre-rendering pages on the server. Deploying Astro with SSR on Cloudflare leverages Cloudflare's edge network for even faster delivery. Here's how to do it:

## Step 1: Build Your Astro Project

Build your project to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This command generates a `dist` directory with your server-side rendered site.

## Step 2: Create a New Cloudflare Account

## Step 3: Create a Cloudflare Worker
- Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and click on Workers and Pages.
- Click Create Application
- Click on the Pages tab
- Click connect to Github

## Step 4: Connect Your Worker to Your Project on Github
Select a repository to connect as your projectâ€™s source code. New commits will trigger Cloudflare to automatically build and deploy your changes.
