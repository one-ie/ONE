Workspaces are designed to streamline your projects. These dynamic spaces allow you to manage multiple aspects of your work from a centralized location, ensuring that everything is seamlessly integrated. You can adjust settings and preferences to match the specific needs of different projects or teams, making every workspace uniquely fitted to its purpose.

- **Customization and Personalization**: Each workspace can be customized with its own name, optional image, and specific AI response instructions. This level of personalization ensures that the AI's interaction is precisely aligned with the workspace's goals.
- **Advanced Settings for AI Interactions**: Users have the ability to fine-tune AI settings, including model selection, prompt preferences, temperature, and context length. Additionally, workspaces can be configured to include profile context and specific instructions in chats, with OpenAI selected as the embeddings provider, tailoring the AI's behavior to each workspace's unique requirements.
- **Effortless Navigation and Management**: Switching between workspaces is made effortless through an intuitive navigation feature, allowing users to move across projects without losing context.  Furthermore, workspace-specific features like embedding models and setting default prompts enhance the workspace's functionality, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of projects.

### 1. Accessing Workspaces

On the top left of the sidebar, to the right of the chat icon, you will see a dropdown menu. If you haven't created another workspace yet this will be called home. You can click the gear icon to access the settings for your current workspace.

### 7. Utilizing Workspace-Specific Features
