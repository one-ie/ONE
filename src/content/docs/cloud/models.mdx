### Accessing Model Management Interface

- Launch the application and navigate to the section designated for models. This might be labeled as “Models,” “AI Models,” or found within a broader section such as “Settings” or “Tools.”

### 2. Creating a New Model

- Look for a button or link to create a new model, typically marked as “Create Model,” “New Model,” or represented by a “+” icon.
- Upon initiating model creation, you'll likely encounter a form requesting details about the model:
    1. **Name:** Enter a descriptive name for your model.
    2. **Description:** Provide a concise description of the model’s purpose or functionality.
    3. **API Key:** Input the API key if the model requires authentication to access an external service or API.
    4. **Base URL:** Specify the base URL if the model interacts with an external service or API.
    5. **Model ID:** Provide the unique identifier for the model if applicable.
- Submit the information to create your new model. The model should now be listed or available within the application's model management interface.

### 3. Configuring Your Model

- After creation, you may need to configure or fine-tune your model's settings. Look for an “Edit,” “Settings,” or “Configure” option associated with your model.
- In this interface, adjust settings such as:
    - **API Key:** Update the API key if it changes.
    - **Base URL:** Modify the base URL as necessary.
    - **Description:** Refine the model's description to keep it accurate.
- Additionally, you may have advanced configurations depending on the application's capabilities, such as setting up headers, request parameters, or defining custom scripts for pre-processing inputs or post-processing outputs.
- Save your changes once you've configured the model to your requirements.

### 4. Using Your Model

- With the model configured, start using it within its intended context. This might involve invoking the model from a UI component, a command line interface, or through automated workflows within the application.
- Input the necessary data or parameters required by the model to generate outputs or perform its designated tasks.

### 5. Monitoring Model Performance

- Regularly check the performance and accuracy of your model. This might involve reviewing logs, output data, or metrics provided by the application.
- Adjust the model configuration as needed based on performance feedback or to accommodate changes in the external API or service it interacts with.

### 6. Deleting a Model

- If a model is no longer needed or if you need to replace it, locate the delete option, often found within the model's settings or details page.
- Confirm the deletion as prompted by the application. Note that this action might be irreversible, resulting in the permanent removal of the model and its configurations.

### Additional Tips:

- Regularly update the API keys and permissions required by your model to ensure uninterrupted service.
- Familiarize yourself with the application’s documentation on models for advanced features or troubleshooting tips.
- Participate in the application’s community forums or support channels to share insights or get help on using models effectively.
