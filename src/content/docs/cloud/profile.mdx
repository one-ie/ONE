Welcome to the central hub of personalisation within our applicationâ€”Your Profile. This is where you make the AI truly yours, by defining your identity, goals, objectives, and dreams. By customizing your profile, you ensure that every interaction and piece of advice you receive from the AI is perfectly aligned with your vision. 

Remember you can  decide if your profile information will be used in different workspaces. This option ensures that the level of personalization can be consistent across various projects, yet allows for control over where and how your personal data is applied.

Now let's make your AI yours by telling it about you and how you would like it to respond. 

## Open your profile

You can open your profile by clicking the icon on the bottom left corner of your screen.
