Here's a step-by-step guide for a user to leverage prompt management features within the application:

### 1. Accessing the Prompt Management Interface

### 2. Creating a New Prompt

- Click on " + New Prompt,".
- In the creation interface, you will encounter two main fields:
    1. **Name:** Enter a name for your prompt. This should be descriptive enough to help you identify the prompt later.
    2. **Content:** Enter the content or the body of your prompt. This could be a question, a command, or any text you want the prompt to display.
- Fill out the name and content of your prompt within the constraints provided (e.g., maximum length).
- Confirm the creation of the prompt by clicking "Create".

### 3. Editing an Existing Prompt

- Locate the prompt you wish to edit. This could be done through a list view, a search function, or within a specific workspace or folder.
- Click on prompt.
- Make changes to the prompt's name or content as needed. 
- Save your changes to update the prompt. The application should reflect your edits immediately.

### 4. Managing Prompt Settings

- You will be able to manage additional settings for each prompt, such as sharing options or assigning it to a workspace.
- Look for a "Settings" or "Options" menu within the prompt's interface to access these features.
- Adjust the settings as necessary, such as changing the prompt's visibility or moving it to another workspace.

### 5. Using Prompts

- Invoke a prompt by using the designated command "/", followed by the prompt name or a keyword.
- Select the relevant prompt from a list or autocomplete suggestions that appear based on your input.

### 6. Organizing and Searching Prompts

- Utilize folders, workspaces, or tags to organize your prompts if the application supports these features.
- Use search functionality to quickly find prompts. You can often search by prompt name or content.

### 7. Deleting a Prompt

- If you need to remove a prompt, locate the delete option, which might be found in the prompt's settings menu or represented by a trash can icon.
- Confirm the deletion. Be aware that this action is irreversible.
