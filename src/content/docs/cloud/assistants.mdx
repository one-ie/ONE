**Your Assistants** are like having a team of smart helpers ready to take on those time-consuming tasks that keep you from focusing on the big picture. Imagine not having to worry about the small stuff because you have these digital helpers that can manage emails, organize your files, or even help with customer questions. Setting them up is easy: just go to the side menu, find where it says "assistants," and you're on your way to creating a new helper. You can give each assistant its own name and job description, and even choose a picture for it, making it easier to remember who does what. You decide how they talk and what tasks they can handle, making sure they fit right into your workflow.

Using **Your Assistants** is as straightforward as chatting with a friend. Select them from a menu and type a quick note and they jump into action.
