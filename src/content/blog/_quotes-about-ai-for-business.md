> “Predicting the future isn’t magic, it’s artificial intelligence.” ~**Dave Waters**

> “I have been banging this AI drum for a decade. We should be concerned about where AI is going.

They are just way dumber than they think they are.” ~**Elon Musk**

> “In most of the use cases we’re seeing, even in business — and there are a ton of interesting uses in business — [AI is] generally about making a human more productive. That’s where it’s really good today.

> “I’ve long believed that AI won’t just enhance the way we live, but transform it fundamentally. … AI is placing tools of unprecedented power, flexibility, and even personalization into everyone’s hands, requiring little more than natural language to operate.

Everyone will have access to amazing AI. Your vendor on that will not be a huge differentiator. Your creative talent though — that will be who you are. Instead of chasing that race to the bottom on labor costs, invest in turning your talent into a team of explorers who can solve amazing problems using AI as the tool that takes the busy work out. That is the company that wins in the end.” – **Vivienne Ming, executive chair and co-founder, Socos Labs**
