# Vision

Free, Fast, Open, Unrestricted, Compliant, Profitable. 
## Zero Marginal Cost



Imagine stepping into a world where the creations of the mind - books, music, videos, software - flow into life as freely as the air we breathe. 

This isn't a distant dream; it's the reality the internet began.
##  Free Production

In the past, producing an extra unit of anything, be it a book or a painting came with added costs. But the digital age changed the game. 

## Free Sharing

Once a digital product is created, sharing it with one person or a million people costs virtually the same: nothing. This is the essence of zero marginal cost, a concept that's reshaping industries and empowering creators and consumers alike.

## FREE Production

Today, we're on the cusp of an even greater transformation, one where artificial intelligence (AI) drives the cost of creating these digital towards zero. This shift is not just significant; it's revolutionary, reshaping the very foundations of our economy and society.

Now, AI is pushing us into uncharted territories. If the internet enabled us to distribute digital products at zero marginal cost, AI is now making it possible to generate these products at near-zero cost. This means creating a custom piece of music, a personalized educational course, or even a software solution can become as easy and cost-efficient as sending an email.

## A World of Abundance

This shift towards zero marginal cost in creation and distribution is not just an economic revolution; it's a gateway to a world of abundance. Imagine a world where educational resources, artistic creations, and even complex software are available to all, fueling innovation, creativity, and learning on an unprecedented scale.

## Why This Matters to Everyone

For entrepreneurs, this means the ability to launch new products and services without the traditional barriers of production and distribution costs. For educators and students, it opens up a toolbox of teaching and learning materials, accessible to anyone with an internet connection. For artists and creators, it offers new opportunities to transform your ideas into reality. The speed and volume that you can create can not be understated. In the time it took to write an email it is now possible to write hundreds of books. 

## Start Fast with our Software as a Service

ONE makes it incredibly easy to get started, use, and become productive with AI. With just a web browser, anyone can tap into powerful applications and services from anywhere, at any time, removing traditional barriers to entry such as complex installations or high upfront costs. Our approach further reduces expenses by allowing you to use your own AI keys, ensuring that you maintain control over your data and costs. This model not provides anyone with access to cutting-edge technology but allows us to provide our core services, free ... forever. 

## Why it is Important to Own Your Data

As you navigate through this era of digital transformation, it's essential to remember the adage, "If the product is free, you are the product." This saying highlights a critical aspect of the digital economy—when services are offered at no monetary cost, the real currency often becomes the user's data. AI's intelligence and effectiveness are directly tied to the quality and scope of the data it learns from. To stay competitive and thrive in the era of AI, owning your own database is not just an advantage; it's a necessity. This personal or organizational database becomes the foundation for informed decisions, customized solutions, and innovative breakthroughs, ensuring you are well-equipped to navigate and lead in the rapidly evolving digital landscape. ONE makes it easy to download your own data, access it from an API and it is designed so you can connect our AI directly to your own database. 

## The Role of Open Source Software

Open source software is software with source code anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. It offers a unique kind of freedom. It's like receiving a book that you're free to read, rewrite, and share, all without needing permission. This freedom doesn't just come from the lack of a price tag; it's about the liberty to use the software in any way you see fit. With open source, you're granted a license that allows you to modify the software to meet your needs, rebrand it, or even sell your modified version. This license is essentially a key to endless possibilities, empowering you to innovate and create without constraints. ONE has an MIT license, carefully selected because it provides the least amount of restrictions, for both enterprises and individuals. When you join our lab you get access to a private Github repo packed with open source software that you can use, modify and profit from, any way you wish. 

## Our Promise: Your Tools, Your Data, Your Future

The potential of open source and data ownership to transform our world is boundless. But realizing this vision requires us to challenge the status quo, to share openly, and to champion the right to own our digital futures. It's about more than technology; it's about building a future where everyone, everywhere, has the power to shape their destiny. At the heart of our vision is you—empowered with the freedom to innovate and the assurance that your data is yours, always. Whether you're crafting AI models, analyzing data, or building the next big thing, we ensure that you're in control every step of the way.

## The Future Starts Now

The power of AI can transform our world in ways we've only begun to imagine. But unlocking this potential means breaking down barriers and sharing the keys to this kingdom. It's not just about technology; it's about crafting a future where everyone has a seat at the table. The movement towards zero marginal cost, powered by AI and open source, is a testament to human ingenuity and our collective desire for a more connected, creative, and equitable world. It's a call to action for all of us to participate, contribute, and benefit from this new era of abundance.

## Shape Your Future

As we stand at the threshold of this new era, the question is not if this transformation will happen, but how we will shape it together. By embracing open source, championing data ownership, and leveraging AI, we can ensure that this shift towards zero marginal cost benefits everyone, everywhere.
